## What is "A New Lecture on Sentences"

**문장론신강 (*A New Lecture on Sentences*)** is a book by Kim Girim, 
published in 1950 by 민중서관(Minjung Seogwan) before the outbreak of the Korean War. 
This work serves as the foundational text on sentence theory, 
addressing the complex relationship between language and literature through an exploration of _spoken_ and _written_ language.

Kim Girim was a modernist theorist deeply engaged in examining the relationship between _spoken_ and _written_ forms. 
His work demonstrates a commitment to establishing correct standards for sentence structure and effective expression. 
He also collaborated with notable literary figures, including 박태원(Park Taewon). 
*A New Lecture on Sentences* became a widely read guide on sentence theory, 
known for his deep insights and comprehensive understanding of language and literary structure.

> He disappeared during the Korean War, so his work is now freely available for publication and research.
